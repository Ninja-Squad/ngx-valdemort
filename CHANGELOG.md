## [9.0.0](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/compare/v8.1.0...v9.0.0) (2022-11-18)

All components and directives are now standalone. The `ValdemortModule` is still usable as it was before, 
but you can also import the directives directly, from your standalone components or from your modules.

We have also updated our [documentation about the integration of ngx-valdemort in Angular Material](https://ngx-valdemort.ninja-squad.com/#/material) 
applications, because a tiny CSS adjustment is now necessary for error messages to look good with material.

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/compare/v5.1.0...v6.0.0) (2021-05-13)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- ngx-valdemort now targets Angular 12.0.0 and Ivy only. If you want to use it with Angular 11.x or View Engine, stick to the previous version of ngx-valdemort. Partial Ivy compilation is now enabled, allowing ngcc to skip this package and you to have faster builds! ðŸš€

### Features

- enable Ivy partial compilation ([5166464](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/commit/51664645d535aa7892dd7f1154dc83f553e827a8))

### Bug Fixes

- renovate config ([80edb78](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/commit/80edb787cdc564faf2433cddfa46b0a1f7fe34fe))

## [5.1.0](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/compare/v5.1.0-beta.1...v5.1.0) (2021-04-09)

### Features

- add a validation fallback directive ([d16d844](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/commit/d16d844f5cdbb9ffbf24ff25dfbc56f09773c3d2)), closes [#264](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/issues/264)

The template of the `valFallback` directive is used for all the errors that exist on the form control but are not handled by any of the specific error templates:

```html
<val-default-errors>
  <ng-template valError="required" let-label>{{ label }} is mandatory</ng-template>
  <ng-template valError="max" let-error="error" let-label>{{ label }} must be at most {{ error.max | number }}</ng-template>
  <ng-template valFallback let-label let-type="type" let-error="error"
    >{{ label }} has an unhandled error of type {{ type }}: {{ error | json }}</ng-template
  >
</val-default-errors>
```

- allow throwing on missing control ([c2b739b](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/commit/c2b739b1bcd0727a4ce13e7cc425824eb7d4792d))

This adds a configuration option called `shouldThrowOnMissingControl` that checks if the control is not found, if set to a function that returns true.
It is set to a function that returns false by default, so this is not breaking change.

This allows to catch situations where the controlName has been wrongly specified:

```html
<input id="firstName" name="firstName" [(ngModel)]="user.firstName" #firstNameCtrl="ngModel" required />
<!-- the control name mentions lastName whereas the control is firstName -->
<val-errors controlName="lastName" id="firstNameErrors"></val-errors>
```

In that case, if the new option is enabled, valdemort will throw:

```
ngx-valdemort: no control found for controlName: 'lastName'.
```

As the option accepts a function, it can easily be enabled in dev and tests, but disabled in production:

```
config.shouldThrowOnMissingControl = () => !environment.production;
```

## [5.1.0-beta.1](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/compare/v5.1.0-beta.0...v5.1.0-beta.1) (2021-04-03)

### Features

## [5.1.0-beta.0](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0-beta.0) (2021-03-26)

### Features

- allow throwing on missing control ([c2b739b](https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/ngx-valdemort/commit/c2b739b1bcd0727a4ce13e7cc425824eb7d4792d))

This adds a configuration option called `shouldThrowOnMissingControl` that checks if the control is not found, if set to a function that returns true.

```html
<input id="firstName" name="firstName" [(ngModel)]="user.firstName" #firstNameCtrl="ngModel" required />
<!-- the control name mentions lastName whereas the control is firstName -->
<val-errors controlName="lastName" id="firstNameErrors"></val-errors>
```

In that case, if the new option is enabled, valdemort will throw:

```
ngx-valdemort: no control found for controlName: 'lastName'.
```

As the option accepts a function, it can easily be enabled in dev and tests, but disabled in production:

```
config.shouldThrowOnMissingControl = () => !environment.production;
```
