This fallback template is used for all the errors that exist on the form control\nbut are not handled by any of the specific error templates:\n  \n    {{ label }} is mandatory\n    {{ label }} must be at most {{ error.max | number }}\n    {{ label }} has an unhandled error of type {{ type }}: {{ error | json }}\n  Using the fallback can also be used to handle all the errors the same way, for example by using the error type as an i18n key\nto display the appropriate error message.\nThis directive stores the default template references in a service, that is then injected in the validation errors components\nto be reused.\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                            AfterContentInit\n            \n\n\n        \n

templates for validation error messages. It's supposed to be used once,\n * typically in the root component. By using templates to do that, error messages can\n * - easily be i18ned\n * - easily use pipes\n * - easily use HTML\n * - easily be ordered\n *\n * Example usage:\n * ```\n *   \n *     This field is mandatory\n *     This field must be at most {{ error.max | number }}\n *   \n * ```\n *\n * Example usage where a label is used to make the messages less generic:\n * ```\n *   \n *     {{ label }} is mandatory\n *     {{ label }} must be at most {{ error.max | number }}\n *   \n * ```\n *\n * A fallback template can also be provided. This fallback template is used for all the errors that exist on the form control\n * but are not handled by any of the specific error templates:\n * ```\n *   \n *     {{ label }} is mandatory\n *     {{ label }} must be at most {{ error.max | number }}\n *     {{ label }} has an unhandled error of type {{ type }}: {{ error | json }}\n *   \n * ```\n * Using the fallback can also be used to handle all the errors the same way, for example by using the error type as an i18n key\n * to display the appropriate error message.\n *\n * This directive stores the default template references in a service, that is then injected in the validation errors components\n * to be reused.\n */\n@Directive({\n  selector: 'val-default-errors',\n  host: {\n    style: 'display: none'\n  },\n  standalone:

    Component allowing to display validation error messages associated to a given form control, form group or form array.\nThe control is provided using the control input of the component. If it's used inside an enclosing form group or\nform array, it can instead be provided using the controlName input of the component.\nExample usage where the control itself is being passed as input:\n  \n    The birth date is mandatory\n    The max value for the birth date is {{ error.max | number }}\n  Example usage where the control name is being passed as input:\n  \n    The birth date is mandatory\n    The max value for the birth date is {{ error.max | number }}\n  This component, if the control is invalid, displays its validation errors using the provided templates.\nThe templates, as shown in the above example, have access to the validation error itself.\nThe label of the control can also be provided as input, and then used in the templates:\n  \n    {{ label }} is mandatory\n    The max value for {{ label }} is {{ error.max | number }}\n  The component‘s behavior is configured globally by the Config service (see its documentation for more details). It can\n\ndisplay the first error, or all the errors\nadd CSS classes to its host  element\nadd CSS classes to each error message element being displayed\nchoose when to display the errors (dirty, touched, touched and submitted, etc.)\n\nGlobal, default templates can be defined (and used by this component) using the default validation errors directive\n(see its documentation for details). So, if the default error messages are defined and sufficient for a given control, all you\nneed is\nor, if the default templates expect a label:\nIf, however, you want to override one or several error messages by custom ones, you can do so by simply defining them inside the\ncomponent:\n\n  You're too young, sorry\nA fallback template can also be provided. This fallback template is used for all the errors that exist on the form control\nbut are not handled by any of the specific error templates:\n\n  You're too young, sorry\n  {{ label }} has an unhandled error of type {{ type }}: {{ error | json }}\nNote that, the fallback template can also be defined in the default validation errors directive (see its documentation for details).\nIf a fallback template is defined inside val-errors, it overrides the default fallback.\nIf an error is present on the control, but doesn't have any template, default template or fallback template defined for its type,\nthen it's not displayed. If the control is valid, or if none of the errors of the component has a matching template or default template,\nthen this component itself is hidden.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    Metadata\n    \n

provided using the `control` input of the component. If it's used inside an enclosing form group or\n * form array, it can instead be provided using the `controlName` input of the component.\n *\n * Example usage where the control itself is being passed as input:\n * ```\n *   \n *     The birth date is mandatory\n *     The max value for the birth date is {{ error.max | number }}\n *   \n * ```\n *\n * Example usage where the control name is being passed as input:\n * ```\n *   \n *     The birth date is mandatory\n *     The max value for the birth date is {{ error.max | number }}\n *   \n * ```\n *\n * This component, if the control is invalid, displays its validation errors using the provided templates.\n * The templates, as shown in the above example, have access to the validation error itself.\n *\n * The label of the control can also be provided as input, and then used in the templates:\n * ```\n *   \n *     {{ label }} is mandatory\n *     The max value for {{ label }} is {{ error.max | number }}\n *   \n * ```\n *\n * The component‘s behavior is configured globally by the Config service (see its documentation for more details). It can\n * - display the first error, or all the errors\n * - add CSS classes to its host `` element\n * - add CSS classes to each error message element being displayed\n * - choose when to display the errors (dirty, touched, touched and submitted, etc.)\n *\n * Global, default templates can be defined (and used by this component) using the default validation errors directive\n * (see its documentation for details). So, if the default error messages are defined and sufficient for a given control, all you\n * need is\n *\n * ```\n * \n * ```\n *\n * or, if the default templates expect a label:\n *\n * ```\n * \n * ```\n *\n * If, however, you want to override one or several error messages by custom ones, you can do so by simply defining them inside the\n * component:\n *\n * ```\n * \n *   You're too young, sorry\n * \n * ```\n *\n * A fallback template can also be provided. This fallback template is used for all the errors that exist on the form control\n * but are not handled by any of the specific error templates:\n * ```\n * \n *   You're too young, sorry\n *   {{ label }} has an unhandled error of type {{ type }}: {{ error | json }}\n * \n * ```\n * Note that, the fallback template can also be defined in the default validation errors directive (see its documentation for details).\n * If a fallback template is defined inside `val-errors`, it overrides the default fallback.\n *\n * If an error is present on the control, but doesn't have any template, default template or fallback template defined for its type,\n * then it's not displayed. If the control is valid, or if none of the errors of the component has a matching template or default template,\n * then this component itself is hidden.\n */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'val-errors',\n  templateUrl: './validation-errors.component.html',\n  host: {\n    '[class]': 'errorsClasses',\n    '[style.display]': `shouldDisplayErrors ?
