given form control, form group or form array.\nThe control is provided using the control input of the component. If it's used inside an enclosing form group or\nform array, it can instead be provided using the controlName input of the component.\nExample usage where the control itself is being passed as input:\n *   \n *     The birth date is mandatory\n *     The max value for the birth date is {{ error.max | number }}\n *   \n * ```\n\nExample usage where the control name is being passed as input:\n\nThe birth date is mandatory\nThe max value for the birth date is {{ error.max | number }}\n\n\n\nThis component, if the control is invalid, displays its validation errors using the provided templates.\nThe templates, as shown in the above example, have access to the validation error itself.\nThe label of the control can also be provided as input, and then used in the templates:\n *   \n *     {{ label }} is mandatory\n *     The max value for {{ label }} is {{ error.max | number }}\n *   \n * ```\n\nThe component‘s behavior is configured globally by the Config service (see its documentation for more details). It can\n- display the first error, or all the errors\n- add CSS classes to its host `` element\n- add CSS classes to each error message element being displayed\n- choose when to display the errors (dirty, touched, touched and submitted, etc.)\n\nGlobal, default templates can be defined (and used by this component) using the default validation errors directive\n(see its documentation for details). So, if the default error messages are defined and sufficient for a given control, all you\nneed is\n\n\n\n\nor, if the default templates expect a label:\n * \n * ```\n\nIf, however, you want to override one or several error messages by custom ones, you can do so by simply defining them inside the\ncomponent:\n\n\nYou're too young, sorry\n\n\n\nIf an error is present on the control, but doesn't have any template or default template defined for its type, then it's not\ndisplayed. If the control is valid, or if none of the errors of the component has a matching template or default template,\nthen this component itself is hidden.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    Metadata\n    \n

It can\n * - display the first error, or all the errors\n * - add CSS classes to its host `` element\n * - add CSS classes to each error message element being displayed\n * - choose when to display the errors (dirty, touched, touched and submitted, etc.)\n *\n * Global, default templates can be defined (and used by this component) using the default validation errors directive\n * (see its documentation for details). So, if the default error messages are defined and sufficient for a given control, all you\n * need is\n *\n * ```\n * \n * ```\n *\n * or, if the default templates expect a label:\n *\n * ```\n * \n * ```\n *\n * If, however, you want to override one or several error messages by custom ones, you can do so by simply defining them inside the\n * component:\n *\n * ```\n * \n *   You're too young, sorry\n * \n * ```\n *\n * If an error is present on the control, but doesn't have any template or default template defined for its type, then it's not\n * displayed. If the control is valid, or if none of the errors of the component has a matching template or default template,\n * then this component itself is hidden.\n */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'val-errors',\n  templateUrl: './validation-errors.component.html',\n  host: {\n    '[class]': 'errorsClasses',\n    '[style.display]': `shouldDisplayErrors ?
